# Create a Global CSS file

Create a new file in `src` called `global.css`. This file will be used to add global styles to the project.

- Remember to use the `:root` selector to define the CSS variables.
- Starts with the shades of gray and continue to add other colors.
- Use the CSS variables (using --var-name) to define the colors of the app by using the `var()` function.
- Use size relatives, like `rem` and `em`, instead of absolute values, like `px`. This will make the app more responsive.

```css

:root {
    
}

```

## Edit index.html

Add the font family and the global CSS file to the `index.html` file.

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8" />

<!-- the fonts link should be added after the meta charset -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>

<!-- the actual link to get the Inter font should be added by the end of the head tag, before the title -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

<title>to-do list</title>
```

Notes:

- As good practice, the `preconnect` links should be the first ones in the `<head>`.
- At the end of the HTML tags that does not need a tag to end, like `<meta>` and `<link>`, we can use a `/` to close the tag. This is not necessary, but it is a good practice.
- 1rem is 16px by default. As example, 1.25rem is 20px.

## Import the global CSS file

Create a basic `src/App.jsx` file and import the `global.css` file.

```tsx
import './global.css'
```
